They may not be as stable as stock, especially with custom kernels or when not stock-based (drivers are hard to get right). 2)Custom themes may not be what you want; many ROM cookers aren't designers.,3)Something unsavory or malicious could be included in the ROM., 4)Bricking your device is always a possibility. Make sure you know what you're doing when you flash a custom ROM, and never use a ROM designed for a different device.,5)Like rooting, flashing a custom ROM will almost certainly void the warranty of a non-developer"
